Eight types of visualizations
#ROC evaluates the non-normalized data for the four recommender systems. The greater area under the ROC curve represents better performance.

##ROC Normalization evaluates the normalized data for the four recommender systems. The greater area under the ROC curve represents better performance.

#precrecall shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for the non-normalized data. The greater area under the prec/recall represents better performance. 

#precrecall shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for the normalized data. The greater area under the prec/recall represents better performance. 

#NormRat shows the normalized realratingmatrix.

#RawRat shows the non-normalized realratingmatrix. 

#NormRatHist shows number of ratings from the normalized dataset. Ratings go from -5 to 5. 

#RatingsHistogram shows number of ratings from the non-normalized dataset. Ratings go from -5 to 5.
