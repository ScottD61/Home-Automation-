ROC evaluates the non-normalized data for the four recommender systems. The greater area under the ROC curve represents better performance.

ROC Normalization evaluates the normalized data for the four recommender systems. The greater area under the ROC curve represents better performance.

precrecall shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for the non-normalized data. The greater area under the prec/recall represents better performance.
